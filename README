Easiest Image Gallery - Ã¼berhaupt

Ever wanted a full-customizable image gallery with multiple albums? 
*Eig* lets you create a galleries by just putting files on your webserver.

Save the pictures of an album in subfolders (so far I just tried numeric names *g) of "galleries" and *eig* will worry about the rest.

Optional you can claim proper headers, subheaders and descriptions in galleries/texts.php for your albums.
The image title, image description and any copyright statements that may arise will be read from the meta data of the image - so you can use your favorite photo-viewer to manage them e.g. aperture. 

Pretty easy - huh?

*Eig* is made by mixing Pixlie, Galleriffic and Easyslider!
